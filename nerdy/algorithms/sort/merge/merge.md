#Insertion sorting
Advance sorting algorithm
##Idea
[Divide-and-conquer algorithm] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer_algorithms)
Divides array into arrays of 1 element each. Then recursively merges them, keeping arrays sorted.
##Real use
Even though this algorithm's complexity is good (O(nlog(n)))), it requires O(n) memory which makes this algorithm unusable in real world. 

##Performance and complexity
Complexity O(nlog(n))).

**Performance doesn't depend on elements' order or structure.**

Memory O(n).
