#Binary search tree.
Data structure.

Type: Tree
##Idea
Binary search trees , sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a class of data structures used to implement lookup tables and dynamic sets. They store data items, known as keys, and allow fast insertion and deletion of such keys, as well as checking whether a key is present in a tree.
##Real use
Fast-style storage - fast search, insert and delete operations.
