#Fibonacci sequence
Numbers in the following integer sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...;
##Idea
By definition, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are either 1 and 1, or 0 and 1, depending on the chosen starting point of the sequence, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
##Formula
F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>
##Bit of history

The Fibonacci sequence is named after Fibonacci. His 1202 book Liber Abaci introduced the sequence to Western European mathematics, although the sequence had been described earlier in Indian mathematics. By modern convention, the sequence begins either with F<sub>0</sub> = 0 or with F<sub>1</sub> = 1. The Liber Abaci began the sequence with F<sub>1</sub> = 1.
