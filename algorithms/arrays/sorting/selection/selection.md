#Selection
Basic sorting algorithm
##Idea
Algorithm finds minimum element in given array and puts it in the beginning of the array. Then finds second minimum element, puts it on the second place etc.
##Real use
Algorithm is very easy to implement. Efficient only for (quite) small data sets.

##Performance and complexity
Complexity worst O(n<sup>2</sup>).

Complexity best O(n)

Memory O(1).
