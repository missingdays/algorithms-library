#Insertion sorting
Basic sorting algorithm
##Idea
Algorithm builds sorted array one item at time.
##Real use
Algorithm is very easy to implements. Efficient only for (quite) small data sets.

##Performance and complexity
Complexity O(n<sup>2</sup>).

**Performance doesn't depend on elements' order or structure.**

Memory O(1).
