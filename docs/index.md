# Welcome to Nerdy documentation

Nerdy is data structures and algorithms library with fully tested and documented code. We try to document every algorithm and data structure as clear as possible, yet providing full overview with correctness and time and space complexity proofs.

Main language we use is Python, but we have plans for implementing everything in C++ and Go at some point.
