## Code storage
Code storage for algorithms, data structures and challenges any level of difficulty. Study case only!

## What's the point?
Firstly, this is my personal storage for algorithms and data structures in whole bunch of languages. Secondly, this repository is a great way to learn algorithms from scratch.
The idea is to store all information about all algorithms in one place, to have code simple, fully commented and documented.

## Where to find stuff?
C_school is where basic algorithms and tasks in C are stored. This is a great place to start your journey.
Most of algorithms are stored in main.

## Why to store full Qt projects?
Qt projects are only stored in c_school. We store raw C/C++ in main.
Remember though, that we want to make repository as easy to use as possible. Languages like Python or Go let you run files just from console. C/C++ require long process of compiling/building. Storing Qt projects lets you clone repository and use it right away! (if you have Qt installed).

## Want to contribute
If you know any algorithm or data structure that is not in the repository and issues yet, issues it for sure! Also you can write existing algorithm in your favorite language and send a pull request with it!
If you have solved any challenges and want to share your solution, you can send task + laguage/name.extention pair in your pull request.  
Please make sure your code works properly before sending a request. Please try to keep your code as simple as possible and as independent as possible (code should include as fewer external libraries as possible and work just on its own).

## What languages and frameworks do I use?
The main languages are Python and C/C++. C/C++ are preferred in Qt-style files, any other language can be added with language/name.extention pull request.
