## Nerdy
Python algorithms and data structures library with good documentation and full tests.

## What's the point?
Firstly, this is my personal storage for algorithms and data structures in whole bunch of languages. Secondly, this repository is a great way to learn algorithms from scratch.
The idea is to store all information about all algorithms in one place, to have code simple, fully commented, tested and documented.
In future this will turn into universal library for algorithms in most used languages.

## Didn't find what you was looking for?

Maybe you will find it here:

http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code - great sites with a lot algorithms. Our repository is inspired mostly by this site.

http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms - wonderful book that helped our repository a lot.

## Help

Help out project with your solutions. See "Want to contribute".

## Want to contribute
If you know any algorithm or data structure that is not in the repository and issues yet, issues it for sure! Also you can write existing algorithm in your favorite language and send a pull request with it!
If you have solved any challenges and want to share your solution, you can send task + laguage/name.extention pair in your pull request.  
Please make sure your code works properly before sending a request. Some tests would help achieving that goal.
