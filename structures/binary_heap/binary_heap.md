#Binary heap
Data structure.

Type: Tree
##Idea
A binary heap is a complete binary tree; that is, all levels of the tree, except possibly the last one (deepest) are fully filled, and, if
the last level of the tree is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.
All nodes are either `greater than or equal to` or `less than or equal to` each of its children, according to a comparison predicate defined for the heap.
##Real use
Mostly used as prioritized  queue.
