#Bubble sorting
Basic sorting algorithm
##Idea
Algorithm repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
##Real use
Algorithm is very easy to code, yet it is too slow to be used in real world, even when compared to [insertion sort](https://github.com/missingdays/code_library/tree/master/main/algorithms/arrays/sorting/insertion).

##Performance and complexity
Performance O(n<sup>2</sup>).

**Performance doesn't depend on elements' order or structure.**

Memory O(1).
