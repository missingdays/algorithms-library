Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:
###Triangle

P3,n=n×(n+1)/2

1,3,6,10,15

###Square

P4,n=n^2

1,4,9,16,25

###Pentagon

P5,n=n×(3n−1)/2

1,5,12,22,35

###Hexagon

P6,n=n×(2n−1)

1,6,15,28,45

###Heptagon

P7,n=n×(5n−3)/2

1,7,18,34,55

###Octagon

P8,n=n×(3n−2)

1,8,21,40,65

The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three interesting properties.

The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two digits of the next number (including the last number with the first).

Each polygonal type: triangle (P3,127=8128), square (P4,91=8281), and pentagonal (P5,44=2882), is represented by a different number in the set.

This is the only set of 4-digit numbers with this property.

You are given a set of numbers N ∈{3,4,5,6,7,8} find the sum of 4−digit numbers from N−gonal sets that respect the above property. If there are multiple such numbers print their sums in sorted order.

##Input Format
